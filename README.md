## How to update the prefixed library

1. Update the version constraint for the original library on the `composer.json` file;
2. Update the version number for this prefixed library in the `composer.json` file with the new version of the original library and the current iteration (4th digit);
3. Run the command `composer update`. The scripts on the `lib` folder will be auto prefixed and the files `include.php` and `Versions.php` class auto generated;
4. Run the tests `composer test` to run tests and make sure the Version class is working properly;
5. Make a manual check in the prefixed library;
6. Commit the changes;
7. Create a new release on GitHub naming it with the original version number and incrementing the fourth digit with the current iteration;
